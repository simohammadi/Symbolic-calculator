# Symbolic-calculator

A calculator that can handle expresions and differentiate. There are five pre-existing functions sin(x), cos(x), log(x), exp(x) and abs(x).

* To define a expression use "(expresion)
* To define a variable use constant/expression=var
* To differentiate use "expression/var'(differnetiate with respect to)
* To evaluate a expression use &var

# Examples

* "exp(x)
* result: exp(x)
* 10=x
* result: 10
* x*10
* result: 20
* "x=y
* result: x
* y'x
* result: 1
* 10=x
* result: 10
* &y
* result: 10
